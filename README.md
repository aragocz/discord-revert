# Discord Revert
Discord Revert is a theme I made because I hate the 2025 desktop visual refresh.

Initial code came from [this thread](https://gist.github.com/n1d3v/0a856d98b9adda5dda96c0deae32b4f3).

# Installation
1. Download and install [Vencord](https://vencord.dev)
2. Download the theme
	- Download the source file and put it into themes folder (default directory `%appdata%\Vencord\themes`) and enable in settings
	- Go to "Online Themes" tab in themes settings tab and paste the following link `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aragocz/discord-revert/refs/heads/main/revert.theme.css`
3. Enable plugin Experiments in vencord
4. Scroll to the bottom of settings and go to Experiments tab
5. Find experiment "Desktop Refresh Fast Follows" (`2025-04_desktop_refresh_fast_follows`) and enable bucket 3
6. Reload Discord and you should be done.

If you're having troubles installing, send me an email at [contact@aragocz.com](mailto:contact@aragocz.com).
